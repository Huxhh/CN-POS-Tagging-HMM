## Experiment
You can see some simple train and test experimental datas in the folder data.  
And the result of pos tagging is in the file *result.txt*, the total average accuracy is about 86.57%.  
But the dataset is small, which only contains 10000 sentences, the result could be better if trained by using a larger dataset.
